excitement and frenzies of the 2018 FIFA world cup has been awesome. We've had a whole lot of drama and surprises since its inception. \n\nThe most painful (and personal) of all the happenings in the ongoing FIFA 2018 World Cup is Nigeria's exit from the competition. A whole lot of Nigerians couldn't hold tears at the sight of her beloved country's eviction from the epochal event. \n\nNigeria was very close to clinching a spot in the second round. The game decisive game against Argentina was the hurdle on the path of the Super Eagles of Nigeria. The team had a couple of clear cut chances, the referee came to their rescue by giving them a penalty, coupled with another controversial \"likely penalty\". \n\nIn my opinion, Nigeria was sloppy in their play. It was apparent they were not set for the World Cup. Their style of play was so basic and devoid of creativity. When you see the play, pass, precision, agility, tactics, and creativity of the Belgians, the Portuguese, star studded Spaniards, skillful Brazilians, and the young and vibrant English side, you'll begin to wonder of my own Nigeria came for the same World Cup.\n___\n**In regards to Nigeria's performance at the World Cup, I'll say, they tried, but at their level of play.**\n___\n### Comic Relief\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dmc_raLpoVc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n___\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UAhIhi38sZY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\nThe second round of the World Cup is upon us, [@blocktrades is organizing a 2000 SBD worth giveaway](https://busy.org/@worldcup-russia/the-knockout-stage-is-on-submit-your-entry-to-keep-competing-for-the-2-000-sbd-prize-pool).

It has been a great moment so far, hilarious and sensational.\nEven it was an unbelievable moment for the defending champ to be evicted from the race so soon. **Guess nobody saw that coming!**\n\nSome defeats are just too mysterious and unbelievable, but it is football. Anything can happen! \nAlthough, my nation was defeated but we had a better game so far in the history of World Cup.

Growing up in a home that always watching and playing football, I have grown to love the sport. Personally, I have been playing football since I was in kindergarten and UEFA Champions League is my favorite tournament to watch. I learned to value teamwork and hard work through football. There is a famous quote from Cristiano Ronaldo that motivated me in every aspect of life: \"Talent without working hard is nothing\". \n\nThrough this contest, I want to test my knowledge of football and hopefully, my predictions will come true.

Since 1992 with all ups and downs Borussia Dortmund followers and also the soccer nation Portugal I have committed myself 2004. Fortunately, I was the highest bidder in the @sportsgeek charity event with this team.\nBut why Portugal. Now that I have always tried to combine holidays and soccer, I was in 2004 for the European Championships in Portugal. In Luis Figo I was in shock love and the whole troupe was really great. Rui Costa, Maniche, Nuno Gomes and 19 year old Christiano Ronaldo! Kati already had jersey number 7 in her handball team - Figo also wore this number 😜. Pity was the lost final against 🇬🇷. But the experience there has pretty much stuck to me. And since I appreciate old virtues in every situation, today I am still loyal Portugal and BVB fan! Well and at BVB I prefer jersey number 11!\n\nSo here are my tips for the round of 16 of the World Cup in Russia.\nScore | Team | vs | Team | Score\n-|-|-|-|-\n2 |France | vs | Argentina | 2\n1 | Uruguay | vs | Portugal | 3\n4 | Spain | vs | Russia | 1\n1 | Croatia | vs | Denmark | 1\n3 | Brazil | vs | Mexico | 0\n2 | Belgium | vs | Japan | 1\n2 | Sweden | vs | Switzerland |3\n1 | Colombia | vs | England | 2\n\n</p>Many thanks to @blocktrades as sponsor of 2,000 SBD!

The surprises for this world cup started even before the tournament even started as World cup giants Italy and Netherlands didn't even manage to qualify. However one thing we could count on and that is the @blocktrade sponsored [competition](https://steemit.com/blocktradesworldcup/@worldcup-russia/the-knockout-stage-is-on-submit-your-entry-to-keep-competing-for-the-2-000-sbd-prize-pool) set by @acidyo and @anomadsoul to continue. All the surprises left me  way behind in a world cup draw that was going to be pretty much without any surprises. So here are my selections.\n\n![WCR.png](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmQHoMixkagzHUHfj5xXHVBhQZZuZDJnHyvn7Ak6Tf8eEo/WCR.png)\n\n\nScore | Team | vs | Team | Score\n-|-|-|-|-\n 1 | France | vs | Argentina | 3 \n 2 | Uruguay | vs | Portugal | 0 \n 2 | Spain | vs | Russia | 0 \n 0 | Croatia | vs | Denmark | 1 \n 2 | Brazil | vs | Mexico | 0 \n 3| Belgium | vs | Japan | 1 \n 2 | Sweden | vs | Switzerland | 0 \n 1 | Colombia | vs | England | 2 \n\n\nHere's my humble take on how this will go \n\n# 1- France Vs Argentina \n\nTo be honest, Argentina hasn't really given a real reason for me to go with this pick since their qualifications, however Deschamps really impressed either with a much better squad, plus all Argentina needs is for Messi to be on from and that's what I count on. \n\n# 2 Uruguay Vs Portugal \n\nWhile Cristiano Ronaldo had a beast of a form that got him a hat-trick against Spain, still we saw how he suffers against a great organized defense in Iran, and even Morocco. Portugal is facing the best defense in the league so far in Uruguay, who achieved perfect record on both ends. Portugal's attack will be up against world class defenders in Godin and Giménez along with their Co. And their attack will be facing another world class attackers in Cavani and Suarez, the first being the top scorer of Ligue 1 and the latter being third behind the best in the world CR7 and Lionel Messi. So I see this going to Uruguay. \n\n# 3 Spain Vs Russia \n\nThe host's run may be heading to an end as they showed weakness when facing a well organized team. While Russia managed to qualify by scoring 8 goals, however those goals were scored against teams with bad forms as Suadi Arabia's disastrous performance gave them their five, and a match against a weak resorts team as Egypt whose main star (Mo' Salah) was coming on with an injury and performed below 50% of his usual self. Russia faces an XI armed with silverware winners,  De Gea who is in the best in the world conversation. a defense line with UEFA Champions league, La liga  and Copa Del Rey winners, a midfield with UEFA Champions league, La Liga, Copa Del Rey, Bundusliga, Europa League and PL winners, and an attack with a CL, and EL winners. Hard to see them getting passed Spain despite them coming off with a weak form. \n\n# 4 Croatia Vs Denmark\n\nDefense and Midfield will be key in this and while I predicted Denmark to take this I won't be surprised if Croatia ends up winning it. \n\n# 5 Brazil Vs Mexico \n\nMexico who managed to defeat Germany will certainly have troubles facing a more organized team such as Brazil, the likes of Neymar, Coutinho, Willian, Jesus, and Ferminho will cause a lot of problems, with Paulinho serving as a threat as well, as we saw in their match against Serbia. Still Casimiro, Thiago Silva, Miranda, Marcelo (Or Luiz) will have the back protected making it hard to see Mexico scoring any goals, and with the attacking force it's hard seeing them not conceding. \n\n# 6 Belgium Vs Japan \n\nWhile Japan managed to pull quite the upset by defeating Columbia and drawing to Senegal, still we must remember that Japan wouldn't have even qualified had it not been for the fact that they received less cards than Senegal in a first of fair play advantage which is a very situational reason to qualify as it depends on the kind of referee they get. Belgium on the other are top of their group and despite a very lackluster win over England in which both teams were obviously aiming for a loss, which was quite the disappointment as I had both Kane and Lukaku in fantasy team created by @acidyo. Still Belgium has a much better, more experienced team whose players play at a much higher competitive level. \n\n# 7 Sweden Vs Switzerland \n\nDefense is key in this one and unlike Switzerland Sweden doesn't lack in that department with a team that received only \ntwo goals from Germany's attacking force but we must remember that the first goal came with a scramble and the second was a result of a way outside the box thinking, Sweden's goalkeeper line and defense have been on form not only in the back but the latter even played parts in assisting and scoring, so it's hard to see Sweden losing to a team who conceded on all of their games with a total of 4 in three games.\n\n# 8 England Vs Columbia \n\nOne of the most competitive matches this round should as while England has much more shiny names Columbia still has few names plus a difficult work rate to beat. Much like Croatia vs Denmark, I see this game going both ways with a slight advantage for England.","reputation":"3483147029646","match":[[1,3,"l"],[2,0,"w"],[2,0,"w"],[0,1,"l"],[2,0,"w"],[3,1,"w"],[2,0,"w"],[1,2,"l"]]},{"link":"https://steemit.com/blocktradesworldcup/@andreina89/the-blocktrades-world-cup-my-selections-for-last-16","author":"andreina89","title":"The Blocktrades World Cup/ My Selections For Last 16","created":"2018-06-29T21:15:42.000Z","last_update":"2018-06-29T21:15:42.000Z","body":"https://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmQHoMixkagzHUHfj5xXHVBhQZZuZDJnHyvn7Ak6Tf8eEo/football-3344911_960_720.png\n\n\n\nScore\tTeam\tvs\tTeam\tScore\n1\tFrance\tvs\tArgentina\t1\n1\tUruguay\tvs\tPortugal\t0\n3\tSpain\tvs\tRussia\t1\n2\tCroatia\tvs\tDenmark\t0\n2\tBrazil\tvs\tMexico\t0\n2\tBelgium\tvs\tJapan\t0\n2\tSweden\tvs\tSwitzerland\t1\n1\tColombia\tvs\tEngland\t2","reputation":"213136295437","match":[[1,1,"t"],[1,0,"w"],[3,1,"w"],[2,0,"w"],[2,0,"w"],[2,0,"w"],[2,1,"w"],[1,2,"l"]]},{"link":"https://steemit.com/blocktradesworldcup/@andrewade/the-blocktrades-world-cup-or-my-selections-for-the-last-16","author":"andrewade","title":"The @blocktrades World Cup | My selections for the Last 16","created":"2018-06-30T01:02:15.000Z","last_update":"2018-06-30T01:02:15.000Z","body":"![New Composition_2018-06-04 15-01-09.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmS8Ujy91xzDMjDtDvBbWaPCFbUKDMJyxQ9u94XvzJ77hE/New%20Composition_2018-06-04%2015-01-09.jpg)\n\nHello steemians, I'm glad to be among the participants of this competition.

Mostly unpredictable with the defending champions -German Machines- out already in the group stage and the Argentinians barely qualifying by defeating the super eagles 2-1 (I guess they were not so super after all😏. However I did predict the outcomes of 20 of the matches and that leaves me with 20points in the blocktrades world cup contest. The first position stands currently at about 32 points (I wonder how he did though 😏, he must be a fortune-teller :)..)\n\nNow the knockout stage is on and the contest just got hotter as this time, scores will be considered. For each correct prediction ( Correct Scores included) you get 3 points and excluding correct scores you score just a point.\n\nThere are 8 games to be played and by my calculations, to get to 32points, I need to predict all games correctly with at least 2 correct score sets or predict at least 4 games correctly (scores included) and fail all others. The first possibility though is more probable.\n\n  Once again special thanks to the sponsors and organizers of this contest.

Thank goodness that is out of the way so I can tell a personal soccer story from a few weeks ago.\n\n### Sometimes fate smiles on you.\n<br>\nA few weeks ago, I discovered that one of my favorite bands of all time , Nine Inch Nails, was going to be playing a relatively small club in Chicago. I first saw them in 1990 and have been lucky enough to see them 3 times since. So this show would be an excuse to relive my youth. To add to the nostalgia, NIN was only selling tickets at the venue. You could not get them via computer in the comfort of your pajamas. You had to physically camp out in order to assure you would get tickets. Figuring that most of the crowd was too old to actually camp out, I was planning on just showing up a couple hours before the sales started. \n\n<br><center>\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao-Sahfy7Hg\n</center><br>\n\nThen I realized, if I traveled into the city, I would miss my daughter's last soccer game of the year. Both of my kids play soccer (not very well... they will be the first to tell you that).  This year many of their games were at the exact same time. Because I do my best  (which is not very much) to help the coach of my son's team, I have missed most of my daughter's games. But on that particular Saturday, I could see them both... if I was willing to pass up waiting in line for concert tickets like the old days. \n\nI hemmed and hawed. Because my daughter doesn't really do much during the games and my wife and I really wanted to see the show, I decided to drive into the city. As I was about to leave, a buddy who was in line texted me. He infomred me that even though he arrived 6 hours before tickets went on sale, there were *thousands* of people in front of him in line. If I left then, there was zero chance I would get tickets. \n\n<center>\n*So Trent, what do you think I should do?*\nhttps://media.giphy.com/media/Q25XQvcPhghRS/giphy.gif\n*Well that is not very helpful.*\n</center>\n\nThat was easy. The decision was made for me. I went to my daughter's soccer game.\n\nI think by now, you have figured out how this 100% true story (I am not kidding) is going to end. With a few minutes left in a game whose score I was oblivious to, my daughter scored her second goal in 6 years of playing ( I had not been present for the first). And it was a real goal! It didn't just bounce off of her. A teammate passed to her, she dribbled a couple of times and swung her leg as hard as she could. The ball popped right over the goalie's head into the goal. \n\n<br><center>\nhttps://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/health/2016/03/03/brandi-chastain-pledges-her-brain-for-concussion-study/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1457017353637.jpg?ve=1\n*Not actual footage. All shirts remained on.*\n</center><br>\n\nGrinning from ear to ear, my incredibly shy daughter did a double fist pump and hurried back to midfield.

From cries of happiness, tears, defeats, victories. For many this has been the world cup of madness, teams have shown that they have broken their barriers and have taken the best of themselves to get where they are right now and how other teams coming from being the best have given to speak for the participation that they have given in this world cup. Personally I never thought that these results would happen, many pools have fallen because the forecasts have not been correct but even here we are continuing to know who will be the winner of this world. First of all I want to thank @blocktrades for helping people to give us a joy in being able to earn something extra and surprisingly like this. We have seen more than 1800 steemians participating in this but few have been positioned among the top positions as I said at first we never think that the results they have put have been as expected. Likewise I want to thank @anomadsoul and @acidyo for organizing this and again helping us to acquire some SBD by predicting the results.
